## Branch flow

On the oval-node, we implemented the [GitLab Flow](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-gitlab-flow/) as default. 

TL;DR is: we have `development` branch as default, checkout to a new branch, do the code, create a PR to `development`, merge, and then create a new PR from development to `master`, not deleting the dev branch.

Some implications need to be clear here:

- Now you should consider branches as environments - PRs merged on different branches will trigger different deploys.

- `master` and `development` have the same code, but they **DO NOT** have the same commit hash git history: The event of merge creates a new commit, so when you merge to the future branch, `master` in this case, the PR **MERGE** will create a new commit **ONLY** on `master`. Take a look on this example repo we made to get this concept

- With that in mind, **NEVER EVER IN ANY CASE DO THE INVERSE** `master` to `development` . This will create a mess (fixable but please, donâ€™t.)
master only accept PRs to avoid errors, so keep in mind to always open the PR to dev first, and then, open from dev to master.

The [main benefits](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/03/05/what-is-gitlab-flow/) we are getting here is have a development environment very reliable, making sure prod only receives tested code, without the complexity of releases, tags and rebases. We just merge, and get it done.

## Branch flow steps

The commands to follow this pattern will be:

```
$ git checkout development

$ git pull

$ git checkout -b {your-new-branch}

```
**ALWAYS** make sure to checkout from a updated `development` branch.

After do your modifications, go thorugh the [github UI](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/oval-node/compare) to open a new PR from `{your-new-branch}` to `development`

Now to get the code to production, on the UI, create a new PR from `development` to `master`.

Remember: **NEVER** the oposite.

After merge `development`into `master`, `master` branch **ALWAYS** will be ahead of development, because of the merge commits, and should increase this number:

Here is an example of how the branch flow should look like in the end of this process:
